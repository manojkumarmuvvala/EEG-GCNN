Graph Convolutional Neural Network
This project is to develop a novel graph convolutional neural network (GCNN) )
– Tools & technologies used: Python , Pytorch , scikit learn, PyTorch Geometric libraries
– In this project we introduce EEG-GCNN, a novel GCNN architecture for multi-channel EEG data inspired by
the clinical significance of brain connectivity patterns in neurological disease pathology. We apply EEG-GCNN
on a large dataset of “normal” EEG recordings and present strong evidence for the ability to distinguish between
“normal” EEGs of neurologically diseased individuals and the EEGs of healthy individuals.
